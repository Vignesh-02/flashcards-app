1. IN html, every time a user submits a form, the page
gets reloaded. To avoid this, we use e.preventDefault()

2. When you are sending json in a post request using fetch to 
post data, make sure to set the correct headers

3. Always make sure index.css with 3 tailwind css classes is imported in main.tsx/ index.tsx!
